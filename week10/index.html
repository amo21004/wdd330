      <h2>Notes</h2>

      <h3>MDN: Validating forms</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Validating form data before sending it to the server is referred to as
          client-side form validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Client-side validation is not a substitute for server-side validation.
          Data validated on the client-side should also be validated on the
          server side. This is because client-side validation can easily be
          spoofed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Client-side form validation can be performed using built-in HTML5
          validation as well as by using JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          HTML5 form validation provides the pattern attribute can that be used
          to validate data using a regular expression.
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript validation can be used with or without the built-in
          validation API (i.e. the Constraint Validation API). Or, it can be
          done using plain vanilla JavaScript.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>MDN: Using Fetch</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Fetch API is a replacement for XMLHttpRequest objects. However,
          XMLHttpRequest objects can still be used.
        </li>
        <li>The Fetch API provides a global fetch method.</li>
        <li>
          A call to the fetch method returns two promises. The first promise
          resolves to a Response object where as the second promise resolves to
          the body of the Response object (which in many cases is in JSON
          format).
        </li>
        <li>
          The first argument to the fetch method is the URL. The fetch method
          also takes an optional second argument which can be used to pass
          custom settings to the method as an object. These settings can include
          method, mode, cache, credentials, among other settings
        </li>
        <li>
          The first promise returned by the fetch method will throw a TypeError
          if there is a network error. Otherwise it returns a Response.ok
          property that's either set to true or false. If the HTTP response is
          in the range of 200 to 299, the value of this property will be true,
          otherwise, it will be false.
        </li>
      </ul>
